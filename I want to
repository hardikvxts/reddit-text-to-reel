I want to quit games, but I want to keep watching porn. What should I watch? What should I avoid? 

As the title says... I'm not trying to make a miracle happen here. I know porn is not going to help me quit gaming. That's just not going to happen. However, I also know that there is porn out there that might make it harder for me. So... what should I avoid? and what should I goon to?

If we could stick to these genres preferably that would be great!

1. Lesbian
2. Soft male dom
3. BNWO
4. Cucking
5. JOI

Before anyone asks, I have my reasons for wanting to quit. I'd just really appreciate if I could get some insight on porn that I should try and porn I should stay away from. 

I'm sure there will be trolls reccomending me porn that are obviously games. Honestly, that's just not cool. For those of you who are facing the same struggle, I’m sure you understand that gaming is the most satanical industry out there 

Again, I'd really appreciate a genuine answer! Thank you.
